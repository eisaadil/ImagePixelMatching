# ImagePixelMatching
Created a GUI to find a matching pixel in another stereo image mathematically using Epipolar Geometry and ZNCC scores (Mid 2021)

Well commented and well organized code, as part of a project for Visual Processing course.

Example of point detected on another image. The square represents region detected, and pixel is the best guess based on ZNCC score. Epipolar lines used to zero-in on candidate area.
